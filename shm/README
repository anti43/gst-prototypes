This example consists of two small python programs: sink.py and src.py. The
script sink.py creates a pipeline consisting of a videotestsrc going into a
shmsink. This script should be started first. It will write its output caps
to a file (named 'caps.txt') that the second script will read in order to know
what media it will find in the shared memory segment.

The shared memory segment is called 'test_shm'. When sink.py is running, it
will appear in the current working directory. If the input in sink.py is
changed to some larger media, the 'shm-size' property of the shmsink element
should be increased accordingly.
